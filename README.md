# Portfolio

Portfolio of projects I have done.

This site has been made purely using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript with no external JavaScript libraries or tools at all, more as a challenge to myself more than anything else.

I find the best way for me to learn is to start from the fundamentals and build up from there, things just make a lot more sense that way, so I like to minimise my reliance on external tools while still being capable of using them when they're suitable for the task at hand.
