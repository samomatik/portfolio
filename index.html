        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hey there!</p><br />
        <p>If you're reading this, I'm really happy that you made it here! As you may know by now, my name's Samitha and I'm working towards becoming a full fledged Web Developer!</p><br />
        <p>I have a great passion for the IT and Computer Science field. Growing up I was building my own computers from 12 years old, and really annoying my father because I would always be breaking something by fiddling around!</p><br />
        <p>I am an entirely self-taught web developer, using resources such as Free Code Camp, The Odin Project, Udemy courses and of course a lot of YouTube tutorials (Thank you LevelUp Tuts and Traversy Media!) 
            Over the last two years I have learnt a lot and hope to continue my education in this constantly growing field.
            Once I believe I am confident in my ability as a full stack web developer, I would very much like to look into data science as it is a fascinating subject and one that I believe will be extremely valuable in todays tech landscape.
            Of course that is more of a long term goal and what I am looking for now is to jump straight into a career in tech, specifically in Web Development, after many years in customer service roles.
        </p><br />
        <p>I have strong skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JavaScript libraries such as React/Redux, jQuery and nodeJS.
            On the back end side of things I have predominantly used MongoDB/Mongoose with some limited experience with SQL.
            I have a solid understanding of Git and how it works as a VCS. 
            What I'm working on now is developing a test-driven development workflow as well as improving my documentation skills, attempting to do it as I go as opposed to being an afterthought at the end of a project.
        </p><br />
        <p>If you would like to contact me, I would love to hear from you! You can email at samitha.312@gmail.com or call me on 0414 885 443.</p>
